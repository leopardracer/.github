🗂 Shardeum overview: Shardeum is an EVM based L1 that uses dynamic state sharding to achieve linearly scalability while attaining atomic composability across shards. This means Shardeum can increase its TPS capacity with each validator added to the network to retain low fees forever.

🌟 About us: Welcome to the Layer 1 blockchain where the community runs the nodes, and auto-scalability means exponential growth.

The main project's source code lives in the [Shardeum](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum) repository, where you can file any code related [Issues](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/issues) and join fellow developers in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/discussions)

Instructions on how to develop and deploy dApps on Shardeum are in the the [Documentation](https://docs.shardeum.org/) as well as instructions on [How to run a Validator](https://docs.shardeum.org/node/run/validator) node.

🌐 Scalability: Thanks to dynamic state sharding, consensus is reached at the transaction level. This means high speed because of parallel processing, and low fees.

🔒 Security: From our combined proof-of-stake and proof-of-quorum approach to consensus, to our auto rotation mechanism we focus on security every step of the way.

🚀 Decentralization: Shardeum is permissionless and built for the community to run nodes that increase TPS (Transactions Per Second), and participate regardless of their locations and backgrounds.
