# Shardeum is the EVM based autoscaling blockchain

Welcome to the Layer 1 blockchain where the community runs the nodes, and auto-scalability means exponential growth.

The main project's source code lives in the [Shardeum](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum) repository, where you can file any code related [Issues](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/issues) and join fellow developers in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/shardeum/shardeum/discussions)

## Scalability
Thanks to dynamic state sharding, consensus is reached at the transaction level. This means high speed because of parallel processing, and low fees.

## Security
From our combined proof-of-stake and proof-of-quorum approach to consensus, to our auto rotation mechanism we focus on security every step of the way.

## Decentralization
Shardeum is permissionless and built for the community to run nodes that increase TPS (Transactions Per Second), and participate regardless of their locations and backgrounds.
